# Face Mask Detection Using CNN

## Introduction:

This project employs a Deep Neural Network, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to differentiate between images of people wearing masks, without masks, and those with incorrectly placed masks. Both manually built and pretrained networks will be utilized to perform this classification task.

### Key Points:

- The Coronavirus pandemic has brought about significant changes in global lifestyles.
- Wearing masks has become crucial for individual safety.
- Detecting individuals without masks poses a challenge due to the large populations.
- This face mask detection project serves as a digitalized scanning tool applicable in various settings such as schools, hospitals, banks, airports, etc.
    - The project utilizes image processing and deep learning techniques to detect people's faces and segregate them into three classes: people with masks, people without masks, and those with partially worn masks.
    - The tool enables remote monitoring of face mask status, allowing efficient supervision and instructions from a remote location.

## Learning Objectives:

Upon completing this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **Load Image Dataset:**
    - Gain the ability to load an image dataset using `ImageDataGenerator` from the specified path directory.

2. **Perform Data Augmentation:**
    - Learn to perform data augmentation on the fly to create batches of the dataset, enhancing model generalization.

3. **Build Convolutional Neural Networks:**
    - Develop skills to build Convolutional Neural Networks tailored for classification problems.

4. **Visualize & Interpret CNN Layers:**
    - Visualize and interpret what CNN layers learn, gaining insights into feature extraction.

5. **Use Transfer Learning:**
    - Apply transfer learning techniques using pre-trained models for effective solutions to classification problems.
